### The goal
#### Write code for the next engineer to <b>read easily</b>
<br>

### Proposal Principles to Use to Achieve the Goal​
~~- Boy Scout Rule​~~ this is just a minor improvement (may risk of breaking things)
- KISS​
- YAGNI​
~~- Keep things DRY​~~ have to do this with special care, sometimes DRY could affect KISS
- SOLID​
~~- Separation of Concerns​~~ not much different than SOLID
